# Chiu2025_Persistence_BehavioralAnalysis
Code associated with "Cell type-specific contributions to a persistent aggressive internal state in female Drosophila" by Hui Chiu, Alice A. Robie, Kristin M. Branson, Tanvi Vippa, Samantha Epstein, Gerald M. Rubin, David J. Anderson, and Catherine E. Schretter. Code was run using MATLAB_R2019a and has a run time of less than 1 min. For all of the code, the input is scores files from a JAABA classifier detailed in Chiu et al. and the output is an ethogram as shown in Figures 2, 3, or Figure 2 Figure Supplement 1. 

This code was originally generated by H. Chiu and modified by C.E. Schretter for use with data reprocessed using the FlyDisco pipeline. 

Prior to use of this code, all videos were tracked using Caltech FlyTracker (https://kristinbranson.github.io/FlyTracker/) and subsequently manually fixed using FixErrors (http://ctrax.sourceforge.net/fixerrors.html) as necessary. Updated perframe features were generated using the FlyDisco Pipeline (https://github.com/kristinbranson/FlyDiscoAnalysis).
